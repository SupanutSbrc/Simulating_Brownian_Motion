A Python-based simulation of the EUR/USD exchange rate by implementing the Brownian Motion stochastic process while comparing with the true values obtained from the historical data.

brownian_motion.py - generates visualizations that illustrate the disparities between the true exchange rate values, forecasts obtained from Brownian Motion with fixed drift parameter and variance parameters, and forecasts derived from Brownian Motion with adjustment drift and variance parameters every step in time.

random_walk.py - generates multiple simulation scenarios. uses the mean and standard deviation of price changes from the historical data and simulates EUR/USD exchange rate changes for five different scenarios from January 3, 2023, to June 30, 2023. The results are plotted alongside actual data, allowing for a comparison of various forecasting outcomes.
